A front-end developer is typically designs and develops web sites, web applications, or native applications running on web technologies. 

The generic job title  describes a developer who is skilled to some degree at HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript and implementing these technologies on the web platform.


(Note: A developer who builds everything was once called a "web master" but as of late these rare and mythical developers are called "full-stack developers").
